#  What's next?

The APP is only developed by me. That means that every new feature takes a lot of my time, wich is splited with my main work. But my intention is to create a couple of key features to make an actual realease of the APP.

* Homebrew Content (classes, races and backgrounds)
* Quick notes
* Content share
* Dice roll
* Multiclass

# How can i download it?

The APP is available [here](https://github.com/joselicht90/Esquire-APP/releases/).
For the time being, the APP is only available for Android (> 5.0). There is an iOS version on the works, but the developer account is to expensive to release it right now.

# Contact

if you discover bugs or any problem with the app you can open an issue right here. Any new idea you have, suggestion, etc, you can make an issue to.

For the time being the code is not open source, but if i get request about this, i'll consider it.
